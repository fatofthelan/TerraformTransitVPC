### AWS Transit VPC (and Spoke VPC) Terraform Template
This is the first draft of the AWS Transit VPC/Subscribing VPC Terraform templates.

#### This Terraform template will:
- Create the Transit VPC and Subscribing (Spokes) VPCs.
- Create and populate the S3 Bucket used for bootstrapping the VM-Series firewalls.
- Spin up 2 Palo Alto Networks VM-Series Firewalls in the Transit VPC, one per AZ.
- Configure VPNs between the Spoke VPC and the VM-Series Firewalls.
- Configure BGP to add routes for the Spoke VPCs.

#### To use this terraform template, you will need to do the following:
- Download and install terraform
- Change any variables in the __vars.tf__ file to suit your needs.
- Define a unique name for the "bootstrap_bucket" variable in the __vars.tf__ file.
- Create a keypair in the key/ directory:
  ```
  ssh-keygen -f transit-vpc-key
  ```
- Duplicate the __spoke.tf__ file for each desired spoke VPC you wish to create and find/replace
  "spoke" with with the name of the new spoke, "prod" for example.(Automated VPNs/Configs only
  work for the first Spoke VPC at this point. This will be addressed in v2.)
- Change the name of the `"spoke_name"` and `"spoke_vpc_cidr_prefix"` variables in each __spoke.tf__ file
  you created in the previous step.
- Run
  ```
  terraform init
  terraform apply
  ```
- After the template runs, you will see each of the firewall's IPs as well as the PSKs for the VPNs.
- Log in to each firewall and import/load each firewall's configuration files from the templates
  directory. __DO NOT COMMIT YET__. Go to the Network tab, IKE Gateways, and open each entry and enter
  the PSKs from the Terraform output. (I'll automate this in v2.)
- Commit and you should all of the VPN tunnels become active as well as their BGP entries.

#### NOTES:
- The username and password from the bootstrap.xml is __paloalto__ / __in*4ksh8JN2kdh__ (be sure to change this once your FWs come up!)
- The AMI used by default is for the Pay As You Go instance of PANOS 8.1. Change the `"palo_alto_fw_ami"` variable to suit your needs.
